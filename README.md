	<h1>ADAN's Language Server for VS Code</h1>
</div>

ADAN is a statically typed, memory safe programming language that strives to introduce a strict and safe type system that primarily focuses on preventing possible memory leaks and unstable code. ADAN has syntax similar to C, to keep familiarity and to avoid having a steep learning curve.

ADAN was developed by [Lily](https://github.com/transicle), [Kauht](https://github.com/kauht), and [Leo](https://github.com/nvttles).

The ADAN LSP (Language Server Protocol) provides various features, such as: **syntax highlighting** and **auto-completion**. Making development in ADAN seamless and less of a hassle.
